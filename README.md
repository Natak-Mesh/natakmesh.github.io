## About Natak Mesh

Natak Mesh was founded to address a critical gap in the market: the lack of reasonably priced IP mesh radio technology. We create accessible mesh network solutions for those who need reliable communication systems without the technical overhead of building and programming them from scratch.

Our mission is to democratize access to advanced communication technology. Our goal is to put powerful mesh network capabilities into the hands of users who value functionality and reliability without requiring extensive technical expertise.
